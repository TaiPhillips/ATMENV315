    "\n",
    "This notebook simulates the activity from the previous class: \n",
    "\n",
    "Each team was given an envelope with an**unknown population of tiles with numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "### {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n",
    "\n",
    "We randomly selected one tile from the population, took note of the number on the tile\n",
    "and returned the tile back into the envelope. This type of repeated sampling from the population is known as \"*sampling with replacement*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment was designed in such a way that one of the six events in the sample space has a lower probability than the remaining five events, which all have the same probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All numbers are evenly distributed: the probability of the event '*tile shows number x*' is the same for all possible numbers x.\n",
    "2. One number has half the probability compared with the rest of the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of interest: **What is a large enough sample size so that we can distinguish between the low-probabilty event and the others. In other words, after how many trials do we have enough observations to detect a difference in the frequency of the events?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Suprisingly, it takes quite a few samples before the random fluctuations in the relative frequency of each event is reduced. The more samples we have in our data set, the more accurate is the estimated relative frequency for each event.\n",
